View updates in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/devlocker/breakfast/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

### Latest Patch `0.6.6`

#### Fixed

- Support Rails 6 by removing constraint on ActionCable

  [@mattr](https://github.com/devlocker/breakfast/pull/32)

### Latest Release `0.6.0`

#### Fixed

- Puma hanging in clustered mode. Breakfast would fail to cleanly exit on Puma
  exit, causing the server to hang indefinitely.
- Bumped Rails version dependency, can be used with Rails 5.0 and greater.
  (Allows usage with Rails 5.1)

#### Removed

- Capistrano rake tasks. Previous behavior has been included into the Rails
  asset:precompile task. Using the standard [Capistrano Rails](https://github.com/capistrano/rails)
  gem is all that required now.
- Need for a custom Heroku buildpack.

### Upgrading

#### Upgrading to `0.6.0` from `0.5.x`

- Update gem with `bundle update breakfast`
- Update the JS package with `yarn upgrade breakfast-rails`
- If deploying with Capistrano, remove `require "breakfast/capistrano"` from
  your `Capfile`. Remove any custom Breakfast settings from `config/deploy.rb`.
  Ensure that you are using [Capistrano Rails](https://github.com/capistrano/rails)
  and have `require 'capistrano/rails'` or `require 'capistrano/rails/assets'`
  in your `Capfile`.
- If deploying with Heroku, run the following commands:
  1.  heroku buildpacks:clear
  2.  heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs --index 1
  3.  heroku buildpacks:set heroku/ruby --index 2

_Note_ If you are deploying with Capistrano then Yarn is expected to be
installed on the hosts your are deploying to.
