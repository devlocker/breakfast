  @haffla

### 0.6.1 - 2017-05-04

#### Fixed

- Potential Heroku bug where assets would be cleared out on deploy.

### 0.6.0 - 2017-03-12

#### Upgrading to `0.6.0` from `0.5.x`

- Update gem with `bundle update breakfast`
- Update the JS package with `yarn upgrade breakfast-rails`
- If deploying with Capistrano, remove `require "breakfast/capistrano"` from
  your `Capfile`. Remove any custom Breakfast settings from `config/deploy.rb`.
  Ensure that you are using [Capistrano Rails](https://github.com/capistrano/rails)
  and have `require 'capistrano/rails'` or `require 'capistrano/rails/assets'`
  in your `Capfile`.
- If deploying with Heroku, run the following commands:
  1.  heroku buildpacks:clear
  2.  heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs --index 1
  3.  heroku buildpacks:set heroku/ruby --index 2

#### Fixed

- Puma hanging in clustered mode. Breakfast would fail to cleanly exit on Puma
  exit, causing the server to hang indefinitely.
- Bumped Rails version dependency, can be used with Rails 5.0 and greater.
  (Allows usage with Rails 5.1)

#### Removed

- Capistrano rake tasks. Previous behavior has been included into the Rails
  asset:precompile task. Using the standard [Capistrano Rails](https://github.com/capistrano/rails)
  gem is all that required now.
- Need for a custom Heroku buildpack.

### 0.5.1 - 2017-02-06

#### Changed

If `public/assets` does not exist Breakfast will now create the folder before
attempting to write to it.

### 0.5.0 - 2017-02-03

#### Added

- Adds support for [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
- New installs now require Yarn
- Capistrano options `:breakfast_yarn_path` && `:breakfast_yarn_install_command`

#### Removed

- NPM client requirement
- Capistrano options `:breakfast_npm_path` && `:breakfast_npm_install_command`
  have been removed.

### Upgrading

#### Upgrading to `0.5.0` from `0.4.0`

- Update gem with `bundle update breakfast`
- Bump the `breakfast-rails` version in `package.json` to `0.5.0`
- Ensure [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install) is installed
- Run `yarn install`

_Note_ If you are deploying with Capistrano then Yarn is expected to be
installed on

### 0.4.0 - 2016-11-14

#### Upgrading to `0.4.0` from `0.3.0`

- Update gem with `bundle update breakfast`
- Bump the `breakfast-rails` version in `package.json` to `0.4.0`
- Run `npm install`

_Note_ Now by default asset fingerprinting will be on by default in production.
A copy of each with the original filename will be present as well, so any
hard-coded links to assets will still work correctly.

#### Added

- Asset Digests. Now when deploying assets will have fingerprints added to their
  file names. This allows browsers to aggressively cache your assets.
- New Option: `breakfast.manifest.digest`. Defaults to false in development /
  test and true everywhere else. When true, enables Rails to serve fingerprinted
  assets.
- Rake Commands to trigger certain behavior:
  - `breakfast:assets:build`
    Manually run a compilation step.
  - `breakfast:assets:build_production`
    Manually trigger a production build. This will cause assets to get minified.
  - `breakfast:assets:digest`
    Run through your compiled assets and add a fingerprint to each one. Creates
    a copy, leaving a file with the original filename and a duplicate with an
    md5 fingerprint.
  - `breakfast:assets:clean`
    Removes any assets from the output folder that are not specified in the
    manifest file (removes out of date files).
  - `breakfast:assets:nuke`
    Removes manifest and fingerprinted assets from the output folder.
- New Capistrano Option: `:breakfast_npm_install_command`
  Defaults to just `install`. Can be overridden to redirect output to dev/null.
  Example:

  ```
  set :breakfast_npm_install_command, "install > /dev/null 2>&1"
  ```

#### Changes

- Fixed small CSS issue if box-sizing is not set border-box globally.

## 0.3.1 - 2016-10-19

- Better support for determining if Server is running. Using puma, passneger,
  etc. instead of the default rails server command now work.

## 0.3.0 - 2016-09-28

### Upgrading from `0.2.0`

- Update gem with `bundle update breakfast`
- Bump the `breakfast-rails` version in `package.json` to `0.3.1`
- Run `npm install`
- If you have modified the `config.breakfast.view_folders` option you will need
  to replace it. The new option is `config.breakfast.source_code_folders` and it
  defaults to `[Rails.root.join("app")]`. If you have view or Ruby files that
  you would like to trigger reloads outside of the `app` folder then append
  those paths by adding:

  ```
  config.breakfast.source_code_folders << Rails.root.join("lib")
  ```

  To which ever environment you want `Breakfast` to run in
  (probably `config/environments/development.rb`).

### Added

- New status bar that allows the user to switch reload strategies on the fly
- Support for Haml & Slim files (without .html extension)
- Reloading on ruby file changes.
- Specify minimum Node & NPM versions when installing (avoid awkward and none
  descriptive error messages)
- NPM binary path for Capistrano

### Changes

- config.breakfast.view_folders change to config.breakfast.source_code_folders.
  Change brought about by need to trigger reloads when Ruby source code changes.

### Removed

- config.breakfast.view_folders is no longer supported. Deprecated in favor of
  source_code_folders option.
